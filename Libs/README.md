You'll need some 3rd party libraries to build this. Rather than include them in the repository I'll leave it up to YOU to put them where they need to be. Here's what you need:

* SDL 2 - https://www.libsdl.org/
* Nxna 2 - https://sourceforge.net/p/nxna/code/HEAD/tree/branches/Nxna2/src/

Your folder structure should look like this:

* This folder
  * Nxna - Everything in the above link should go in there
  * SDL
    * Windows - Basically, take the SDL zip and extract it into this folder and it should work
      * include
      * lib
